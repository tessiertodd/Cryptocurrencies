# Cryptocurrencies

## Overall Objective
We are working to help Martha who works at an investment bank to better understand cryptocurrencies as they are looking to offer thier clients a cryptocurrency investment portfolio .  We will be using Unsupervised Machine Learning to learn about the cryptocurrency data so we have a better understanding of the cryptocurrencies being traded and how they could be grouped together into a potential classification system for the investment product.

## There are four key things we will be doing to help us understand and visualize the data

### 1) Preprocessing the Data for PCA

### 2) Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

### 3) Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

### 4) Visualizing Cryptocurrency Results

## Conclusion
Data in the real world is much like that we encountered with the cryptocurrencies, not always ready for analysis like Unsupervised Learning.  That is why we needed to take some time up cleaning and shaping the data so we could run through the unsupervised learning models or other models/analysis.
